There was no way my browser read the style.css sheet, that is 
why (to not lose more time), I decited to do the whole thing in codepen
and cut and paste to VS. I took most of the pictures src from the current page 
of npr and changed them to the original pics when pasting in Visual Studio. 

So... I DO NO KNOW how is looking or if it works buuuut, looks great un CodePen.
Here is the link, just in case:

Since I finished all the prework i'm currently trying to fix this issue
